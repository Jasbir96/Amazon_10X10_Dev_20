another chaotic, intense night at the IPL. This tournament is slowly picking pace. Tomorrow it is Rajasthan Royals against Chennai Supers Kings. We'll see you there - good night!<br><br></p><p><b>Y Chahal:</b> When I bowled my first over, there was a little grip. I decided to bowl a stump to stump line and my captain told me to go for attacking deliveries. One point of time they were batting well, so I can't bowl every ball fast. So I bowled wider and turning, which is difficult to hit. For Bairstow I went straighter and a little leg side because it's difficult to hit from there. For Shankar, Kohli came up to me and we decided to go for the googly first up.<br><br></p><p><b>Yuzvendra Chahal is the Man of the Match.</b> <br><br></p><p><b>Virat Kohli:</b> It's amazing  to be honest. Last night we were only the other side of the result, 6-nil. Nice to be 1-nil. We kept our composure and Yuzi comes in and completely changes the game for us. Not many spinners got much out of the pitch, but tonight he showed that you can turn it if you have it in your wrists. He turned the game. To be honest, we started really well. Devdutt was really good on debut, Finchy as well. But whenyou lose two in two, you have to consolidate. If not for two in two, you were looking at maybe 10-20 runs more. In the past if we had 43 off 5, you'd see the shoulders dropping but the guys kept believing, kept attacking. Someone like Washy not bowling enough and a part-timer doing it are good signs.<br><br></p><p><br><br><b>AB de Villiers:</b> Big surprise for me! [His innings]. It's a nice change to get on the right side of a close game early on in the season. We worked very hard for the win. It's a great start for us and hopefully a good sign of things to come. I surprised myself to be honest. We had a competitive game in South africa, which was great, gave me a little bit of confidence. As a 36-year-old to come here, having not played a lot of cricket, in the middle of some talented youngsters - was a pleasing start. Very happy with the basics, seems to be in place. [Padikkal] It's a tough thing to arrive at the IPL, they don't come more tough than that. The talent is just incredible. Every year there are 19 and 20 year olds coming through looking like they've played international cricket for a long time.<br><br></p><p><b>David Warner:</b> Yeah look, can't remember I was out like that. It was a bizarre game for us. Obviously RCB played well here to get across the line. A lot of courage for Mitch to walk out. <b>Doesn't look great, he can't put any weight on his leg.</b> We always knew that they had to get some bowlers out at the end. Probably that last over of Chahal was the turning point there. We've obviously go back to the drawing board. We can't fix what happened tonight. Everyone knows that [to play Chahal out at that point], it is a talking point, but the guys don't need reminding. <br><br></p><p><hr></p><p>Gaurav: "RCB needs to have a look at bowlers who are going to bowl death overs for them. Come Russells n Pollards n it's gonna be an entirely different ball game. Dale Steyn hardly looks a safe bet."<br><br></p><p>Srinath: "Apart from Warner, Bairstow and Pandey can any of the other players bat or can be relied upon to guide the team home? Doesnt look too good for SRH going forward...."<br><br>Nctbadri: "Happy for RCB, given they can easily strengthen team from here ..umesh has to be out and sundar can't play if he is going to bowl 1 over ! That's 2 slots plus if finch replaced by Kohli at top, they can add 1 more in the middle ..."<br><br>Abhishek: "Don't count out contribution of Navdeep Saini. Broke the middle order into two parts in just one over."<br><br>Gaurav: "Not coming hard on Vjay Shankar. But he needs to take a good hars look at his career so far. I can only remember his failures. The one against Bangladesh in Nidhas Cup. Replacing Rayudu in WC19 n coming dud. Sparking a collapse tonight. Just an honest observation."<br><br>abhishek singh: "ahh nothing special, its 2020.... RCB winning while defending......"<br><br></p><p><b>9:59pm</b> A quite extraordinary collapse. Sunrisers were 121 for 2 with five balls of Yuzvendra Chahal to play out. Bairstow looked to slog one, Shankar was completely bamboozled and within a couple of minutes, their most experienced remaining batsmen were gone. The collapse eventually read 8 for 32 in 26 balls. Quite something. RCB left it quite thin with their bowling, Chahal pretty much being their big throw of the dice, but it worked out, and from there they completely grabbed the opportunity after being knocked around easily for the most part. Shivam Dube in particular would have excited his skipper at the end, with Saini doing what was expected off him. A good start to them with their recalibrated team. Despite the hiccups, they've managed to pull one off early in the season.</p></div></div><div class="d-flex match-comment-padder align-items-center"><div class="col-2 col-md-1 col-lg-2 match-comment-run-col"><span class="match-comment-over">19.4</span><div class="match-comment-run-container"><div class="match-comment-run match-comment-run-wicket"><span>W</span></div></div></div><div class="col-14 col-md-15 col-lg-14"><div style="padding-right:16px"><div class="match-comment-wrapper"><div class="match-comment-short-text"><span>Steyn to Sandeep<!-- -->, <!-- -->OUT</span></div><div class="match-comment-long-text" itemProp="articleBody"><p><b>taken at long-on!</b> That's the win for RCB.

Devdutt was really good on debut, Finchy as well. But whenyou lose two in two, you have to consolidate. If not for two in two, you were looking at maybe 10-20 runs more.

Bairstow looked to slog one, Shankar was completely bamboozled and within a couple of minutes, their most experienced remaining batsmen were gone. The collapse eventually read 8 for 32 in 26 balls. Quite something. RCB left it quite thin with their bowling, Chahal pretty much being their big throw of the dice, but it worked out, and from there they completely grabbed the opportunity after being knocked around easily for the most part. Shivam Dube in particular would have excited his skipper at the end, with Saini doing what was expected off him. A good start to them with their recalibrated team.
